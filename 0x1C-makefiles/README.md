# 0x1C - Makefiles

In this project I have practiced writing Makefiles.

## Tests:
* [tests](./tests): A folder for test files.

## Helper Files:
* [school.c](./school.c): C function that displays a seahorse in text form.
Used in Makefile for practice purposes throughout the project.

* [main.c](./main.c): Main C function that runs the function defined in [school.c].

## Header File:
* [m.h](./m.h): Header file defining the function prototype used in [school.c].
